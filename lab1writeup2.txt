Initial Decisions

We decided to use Python because it's fast to code in and has easy list 
manipulation and string parsing.

Notes on Architecture

We used lists of strings because Python has simple functions to convert CSV 
into lists.

 Task Log

Modifying grade query to accept optional argument - Mitchell – 5:30 – 6:00 - 0.5 hours
Classroom Query - Andrew - 0.5 hr
Reorganizing Classes - Mitchell - 1 hr
Splitting database into 2 to comply with data files - Mitchell - 0.5 hours

Testing

We found that the data files for this project were incompatible at first, but
eventually found that we had to strip the newline character from each line.
Took about 1 minute to fix.

Purpose of this assignment

The purpose of this assignment is to demonstrate all the work it takes to
fufill basic query commands for a DBMS. We learned that even the most basic
query language takes a lot of code to implement correctly and are easy to
break. Also if we were to scale this project, it would take a different
approach than calling everything into memory.
