Initial Decisions

We decided to use Python because it's fast to code in and has easy list manipulation and string parsing.

Notes on Architecture

We used lists of strings because Python has simple functions to convert CSV into lists.

 Task Log

Parsing commands – both – 4:30 – 5:00 - 0.5 hours
Writing different versions of the search for every case – both – 5:00 – 5:30 - 0.5 hours
Modifying code to incorporate interpreter mode – both – 5:30 – 6:00 - 0.5 hours
Debugging – both 4:30 – 5:00 - 0.5 hours

Notes on Testing

Forgot to strip newline from interpreter mode input, so 'Quit' was being compared against 'Quit\n'. Took one minute to find. Otherwise, testing was pretty straightforward, mostly involved formatting output. We tested multiple queries of each type, including bad input. We also tested for bad files.
